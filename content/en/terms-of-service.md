# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we") welcomes you! 👋 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially giving us a virtual high-five and agreeing to these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** offers users awesome paid subscription content and membership services, including, but not limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this cool content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy-peasy!
*   **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their accounts secure and for all activities happening under their watch. Oh, and here's a big no-no: transferring or sharing accounts is strictly prohibited. Keep it to yourself, champ! 🚫
*   **The Site** reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts if users decide to go rogue and violate these terms. Play fair!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis – you pick your flavor! The exact fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page, no hidden surprises.
*   **All payments** are handled securely through awesome third-party payment platforms like Stripe and PayPal. Rest assured, the Site doesn't store your payment info. We're all about privacy!
*   **Subscriptions** will automatically renew, keeping the good times rolling, unless you decide to cancel before your current billing cycle ends. You're in control!
*   **First-time subscribers** get a sweet deal: if you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these Terms and tell us what went wrong. Heads up, though: each user gets one shot at this refund magic. After 14 days, or for our returning champions, payments are generally non-refundable unless the law says otherwise. So, make sure you love it! ❤️

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday). So, please, no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without getting our green light first. Play nice with our brain juice!
*   **Users** only get non-exclusive, non-transferable access purely for personal learning and reading. It's like borrowing a cool book, not owning the library.
*   **For commercial use or extensive citation**, just reach out to the Site for authorization. We're usually pretty friendly!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Users** are strictly prohibited from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon anyone else's rights. Let's keep things positive and respectful!
*   **Users** are also prohibited from using sneaky technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack membership content. That's a definite no-go! 🙅‍♀️
*   **The Site** has the right to zap inappropriate content and give violating users the boot. We keep our community safe and sound.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruption
*   **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's a dynamic world!
*   **The Site** isn't liable for any compensation if content goes temporarily dark due to things we can't control, like acts of nature, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen! 🤷‍♂️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference and doesn't count as professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Always consult the pros for that!
*   **The Site** isn't responsible for any direct or indirect losses users might face from using our content or services. Use your best judgment, folks!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, United States, ignoring any pesky conflict of laws principles. Keeping it clear!
*   **Any disputes** popping up from or related to these Terms? Let's try to chat it out first, amicably. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California.

## 9. Contact Info
*   **For any questions** about these Terms, don't hesitate to ping us via:
